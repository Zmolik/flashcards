# flashcards
Flashcards as a python program. Create or import flashcards. Train flashcards and track answer-error score.


Start the program using commandline:  
 usage: flashcards.py [-h] [--import_from IMPORT_FROM] [--export_to EXPORT_TO]  
  
optional arguments:  
  -h, --help            
  show this help message and exit  
  --import_from IMPORT_FROM  
                        Imports flashcards from specified json file  
  --export_to EXPORT_TO  
                        After typing "exit" the program exports all flashcards to specified json file  


Learning outcomes:  
I've learn how to work with files and call them from the command line using argparse library.
